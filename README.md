**This only includes files for compiling the Faz-Anim PC and VR builds of the RR Engine.**
# Description
The RR Engine is a Unity codebase for simulating and animating old animatronics, with various features to customize the viewing experience.

The sofware is split into two major sections. The Editor Mode allows users to maticulously look and edit animation files,
while giving a variety of analysis options. The Game Mode provides a first person view of the animatronic stages, 
allowing the user more customizablity in the presentation, while also giving simplified controls. The Game Mode also
has features to unlock special items as rewards for animating the simulated animatronics. This is usually stage props
or movable animatronics, allowing the player to create a fully custom stage or layout to host their animations.

This source only provides the Faz-Anim branch of the RR Engine, with no access to any empty starting branch or the
upcoming Reel 2 Real (RR) Branch. Some of the Reel 2 Real code may be present and go unused in the Faz-Anim branch,
but should not be marked as an issue.
